# FlappyBirdGame (JavaFX)

A simple Flappy Bird style game built as a Java course project using JavaFX.

What it includes:
- keyboard controlled gameplay
- menu screen and basic game flow
- multiple levels and different enemy/power-up types (separate classes)
- highscores saved locally

What I practiced:
- object-oriented design (inheritance/polymorphism, clear class responsibilities)
- separating game logic from rendering
- JavaFX event handling and animation loop
- file I O for persistence (highscores)
- Git during development
