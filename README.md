Object Oriented Programming in Java

A small collection of course projects from an Object-Oriented Programming course in Java (incl. JavaFX).

Included:
- AdventureGame (text-based game)
- FlappyBirdGame (JavaFX)
- NewPaint (JavaFX)

What this repo shows:
- clean OOP basics: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism
- splitting responsibilities (model vs UI / game logic vs graphics)
- working from requirements and turning them into code
- JavaFX event handling (keyboard/mouse)
- simple persistence where needed (e.g. highscores)
- Git used during development
